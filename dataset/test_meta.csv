For over two months, Hong Kong's protesters have shown an uncanny ability to learn and adapt, whether it's figuring out how to deal with tear gas, crowdfunding massive amounts of money, or coming up with creative new ways to protest. Learning how to use Twitter, however, is proving to be a much harder task.
With no solution in sight to the political crisis that has gripped Hong Kong for 13 weeks, a growing number of Hong Kong protesters see international support or intervention-mostly from the US-as something that could boost their chances of success. That's driving more people in Hong Kong to get on Twitter, hoping the global platform can help get the message out to an audience that includes prominent foreign politicians and major news networks.
One 39-year-old woman  who only wanted to be identified as Purple Light-a translation of her Chinese name-said she just joined Twitter this month because she realized the platform is a vital way to deliver information about Hong Kong to the world. But she finds some functions of Twitter confusing, for example the difference between retweeting and retweeting with a comment. ""I discovered that there's a 'language' to Twitter that I haven't quite yet grasped,"" she said.
Another recent Twitter joiner, a male Hong Konger living in the US who didn't want to divulge any further personal information, said that privacy concerns in a climate where doxxing is prevalent on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram made Twitter an attractive platform because of its greater potential for anonymity.
In addition to Facebook and Instagram, the dominant social networks in Hong Kong, protesters also heavily rely on chat app Telegram and LIHKG, a Reddit-like forum, to discuss and organize, but there's a growing realization that those platforms are too inward-looking.
LIHKG is rife with discussions on how to use Twitter. One recent post titled ""Twitter! Open Twitter! Must use Twitter!!! Begging everyone"" exhorted the ""promotion department"" of the protesters-a term meaning those who create artwork or text posts for sharing-to pay more attention to Twitter in order to counter the growing number of ""fake news"" posts aimed at discrediting the movement. Other threads crowdsource English translations for videos and images the protesters would like to push to global readers on Twitter, such as those from Aug. 31 when police entered multiple subway stations and beat up and arrested passengers.
Others are trying to help Hong Kong protesters get to grips with Twitter in different ways. An anonymous person created a set of public Google documents containing detailed information about the social network, including a list (link in Chinese) of suggested accounts to follow, mostly well-known US politicians, personalities, and media outlets and journalists, including Oprah Winfrey, Donald Trump, and US senators like Marco Rubio and Nancy Pelosi.
Though Twitter said in a statement that it does not disclose user information by market, there has been a discernible increase in Hong Kong users signing up for Twitter accounts in recent weeks. As a result, various Hong Kong-related hashtags have started to trend, such as #Chinazi and #SOSHK, as well as #FollowBackHongKong, a hashtag launched by long-time Twitter user @Goofrider, an amateur photographer who only wanted to be identified as Jeff, to help boost newcomers' follower counts.
One Telegram group called ""Twitter consensus channel"" even holds regular polls to decide what topics to push on Twitter, including one that asked whether members supported using the hashtag #StopTheCoup in an attempt to link protests in the UK with those in Hong Kong to create solidarity (though some have cautioned users not to go overboard with hashtags). Another polled what topics members wanted to push on Aug. 28 on Twitter, with options including alleged sexual violence by police against female arrestees, ""white terror"" against companies including Cathay Pacific, or the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which protesters are urging US members of Congress to pass this month.
One of the administrators of the group, who would only be identified with his user name on Telegram, VladimirPutin852, said the polls were a ""democratic"" way of deciding what people should tweet about given that, like the protests more broadly, the group is leaderless. The person, who lives overseas and is in their late 20s, joined Twitter in August and wanted to help others navigate the platform as a way of contributing to the protests.
One of the major stumbling blocks for Hong Kongers taking to Twitter is language. One user, @woppa, a retired 40-year-old called Trevor who resides in Canada, started a hashtag that translates as ""Get in there if you want to learn English"" to help Twitter novices from Hong Kong. Trevor, whose tweets double up both as language and Twitter etiquette pointers, said that ""overcoming the language barrier"" was the protesters' biggest challenge.
Recent pieces of advice he's given to people: don't arbitrarily just tag major news accounts like Fox News, how to embed videos rather than just posting a link, and what the term ""fire"" means in internet parlance.

In the photo, the boy can be seen wearing a dark shirt and tie, light slacks and a red swastika armband. He also appears to be wearing a black mustache.
""The Davis School District apologizes for what took place yesterday. It does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form.

2,,Utah elementary student wears Nazi costume in Halloween parade. The principal and teacher are now suspended.,"
 The principal and a teacher at a Kaysville elementary school were suspended with pay after allowing a student to dress in a Nazi costume in a Halloween parade.
 The image of the child - dressed in tan pants and a brown shirt with a red arm band adorned with a black swastika - began circulating on social media after the Thursday parade at Creekside Elementary. Many commenters expressed outrage at whoever allowed the child to wear the costume, while others supported the boy.
 In a statement, the Davis County School District apologized for the costume.
 ""[The district] does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form,"" the statement read. ""The district is taking the matter very seriously and is investigating every aspect of the situation.""
 School district spokesman Chris Williams declined to name the faculty members who were placed on paid leave, but the elementary school's website lists Steve B. Hammer as the principal.
 The school hosts kindergarten through sixth grade students.
 Schools in the district have faced criticism this year for alleged racism and religious insensitivity. 
 A teacher at Valley View Elementary School in Bountiful was disciplined in March when she asked a fourth grade student, who is Catholic, to remove an ash cross from his forehead on Ash Wednesday.

A Utah elementary school principal and teacher have been suspended after a student wore a Nazi costume during the school's Halloween parade last week.
Parents were shocked and horrified when the boy, who has not been publicly identified, donned a fake Adolf Hitler-esque moustache and a red armband emblazoned with a swastika during the event Thursday at Creekside Elementary School in Kaysville, according to local news reports.
Two parents told local Fox affiliate KSTU that the student was doing a Nazi salute during the parade. Both parents, who wished to remain anonymous, are questioning why school officials allowed him to participate in the parade dressed as a Nazi in the first place.
One of the parents said they called the school to complain the day after the parade and were told the student had been removed from the parade, ordered to change his clothes and that his parents were notified. But the mother said she felt the behaviour had been excused by administrators.
""I was told that [the school] thought he was Charlie Chaplin,"" she told KSTU. ""And like, he has a whole swastika on his arm. ... He had to have been seen by his teacher, by multiple people.""
Video and images of the student's costume gained attention after being posted to a Facebook page for local mothers, reported Deseret News. The woman who shared the photo called the costume as ""ridiculous and distasteful as one could get"" and said the boy was ""Hailing Hitler"" in the face of the ""few minority children who attend the school.""
The Davis School District apologised for the incident in a statement sent to HuffPost on Monday and said it was investigating ""every aspect of the situation.""
The school district ""does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form,"" according to the statement. ""The district is taking the matter very seriously and is investigating every aspect of the situation.""
The principal and teacher have been placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation, the school district said in its statement. A representative for the school district declined to confirm the identity of the staff members.
Creekside Elementary School, located about 20 miles north of Salt Lake City, serves more than 750 students from preschool to sixth grade.
In a statement Saturday, the United Jewish Federation of Utah said it's ""appalled"" that the student was allowed to participate in the parade apparently dressed as Hitler.
""Almost all Jews and Americans regard Hitler and Nazi symbols as signifiers of the worst hatred, racism, and crimes against humanity that the world has known,"" the organisation said in its statement. ""Dressing a child as Hitler is intolerably offensive and should never be suggested, permitted, or condoned.""
Anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise nationwide in recent years. The  Anti-Defamation League reported in April that assaults against Jewish people in 2018 were more than double the number reported in 2017.

FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - A man accused of killing a Peeping Tom for looking through the window of his girlfriend's house in Fort Lauderdale in 2018 has been arrested.
Police arrested him on a warrant Thursday.
In early July 2018, Delray Beach resident Victor Vickery, 30, was spending the night at his girlfriend's house at 2100 block of Northeast 61st court when they noticed someone looking through her bedroom window.
According to an arrest report, Vickery's girlfriend, Samantha Hobi, had previously reported several instances of a suspicious person on her property.
Police said while Hobi called 911, Vickery went outside and confronted the man, starting a fight that ended with Vickery beating him to death with a shovel, his fists and his feet.
Fort Lauderdale Police found the Peeping Tom, identified as 57-year-old Asaad Akar, dead and covered in blood when they arrived.
Upon the State Attorney's Office review of the case conducted by detectives, prosecutors determined they had sufficient evidence to charge Vickery with manslaughter.
Vickery is currently being held on $100,000 bond.

7,en,Delray man arrested in 2018 'peeping Tom' killing,"
The Delray Beach man was arrested at work in Boca Raton this week on a manslaughter charge in the 2018 beating death of Asaad Akar in Fort Lauderdale.
BOCA RATON - A Delray Beach man charged in the 2018 beating death of a ""peeping Tom"" was arrested Monday afternoon at his workplace in Boca Raton, police records show.
Victor Van Vickery II is accused of fatally beating 57-year-old Asaad Akar late July 2, 2018, outside the Fort Lauderdale home of Vickery's girlfriend.
Boca Raton police records indicate that Broward County Sheriff's Office authorities tracked the 30-year-old to the call center in Boca Raton where he was working.
Sheriff's authorities alerted Boca Raton police because the office sits in the city's jurisdiction northwest of the intersection of Glades Road and Dixie Highway.
Vickery was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. Monday and booked into the Palm Beach County Jail on an out-of-county warrant, records show. He was transferred to a Broward County jail on Thursday where he is being held on in lieu of $100,000 bail on a manslaughter charge.
Fort Lauderdale police records indicate that Vickery's girlfriend called 911 shortly before midnight July 2, 2018, to report that a suspicious person was peering in her window - again. She had made multiple reports to police over several years about somebody coming into her property and looking through her windows, she told the dispatcher.
Her boyfriend was fighting with the man outside and trying to hold him down until police arrived, she said.
During the 3-minute call she is heard saying ""Tory, stop. Tory, that's enough,"" according to police records. The arrest report indicates that the woman referred to Vickery as ""Tory.""
Vickery told city police that when they heard scratching on a window in his girlfriend's bedroom, he ran outside the back sliding-glass door and saw Akar with his pants unzipped in the fenced-in yard. Records indicate that Akar lived about a 2-minute walk from the woman's home.
Vickery said Akar lunged at him and the two began fighting. Vickery, who was not wearing clothes, said he was afraid for his safety, so he kicked and punched the man.
Officers noted that Vickery's foot was swollen and bloodied. He had dried blood elsewhere on his body as well, records state.
Broward authorities filed the manslaughter charge against Vickery on Sept. 30. It was not clear Friday why they waited to charge Vickery, although it appears that his girlfriend at the time went to police in July of this year and recanted her initial statement in which she said she also hit Akar when they spotted him outside her bedroom window. She said Vickery told her to tell police that she hit Akar with a shovel.
Records indicate that months after Akar's death, that woman filed a restraining order against Vickery, which eventually was dropped. In August 2018 he was arrested for reportedly raping a woman, whom redacted court records identify only as his former girlfriend. It is unclear whether she is the same woman who called 911 the night Akar was killed. That case remains open.
Police noted in their report that Akar had been accused of ""peeping into windows"" of other homes and indicated that he has ""a previous history of arrests for doing the same,"" though details of those cases were not available Friday.
In an online obituary for Akar, who died shortly after 1:30 a.m. July 3, 2018, the Fort Lauderdale resident is remembered as a ""devoted son ... and a kind soul, who was generous with his time and knowledge to all that needed him.""

Victor Vickery is being charged with manslaughter after beating and killing 57-year-old Asaad Akar for watching Vickery and his girlfriend have sex through the window last year.
Akar lived a short walk away from the Fort Lauderdale home with his mother, who grieves for her son every day.
""At the end of this month, it will be one year and four months; I miss him all my life,"" Akar's mother said.
In the initial police interview in 2018, Vickery's then-girlfriend, Samantha Hobi, had stated that she hit Akar with a shovel as the two men fought outside her home that night. However, Hobi recanted that story, stating that Vickery was the only one that laid hands on Akar.

A Florida man who caught another man looking into his window while he had sex with his girlfriend has been charged with manslaughter after beating him to death.


Victor Van Vickery II, 30, was arrested last week in the July 2018 death of 57-year-old Asaad Akar, the Palm Beach Post reported.


Just after midnight on July 2, 2018, Vickery's girlfriend called 911 and reported that he had caught a man, Akar, outside her Fort Lauderdale bedroom window with his pants unzipped, police said.

Months later, the woman filed a restraining order against Vickery, but later dropped the claim.


Vickery was also arrested for raping an ex-girlfriend in August 2018, but she was not identified, according to the newspaper.

A man in South Florida was arrested and charged with manslaughter after police say he beat a man to death for watching him and his girlfriend through a window.
Police say Victor Vickery, 30, was naked and getting intimate with his girlfriend at her Fort Lauderdale home in July 2018 when they noticed a man peering at them from outside. Police received a call from the girlfriend, Samantha Hobi, that Asaad Akar had been looking through her windows and that Vickery was holding him down in the yard.
Police officers arrived on the scene to find Akar, 57, unconscious and ""covered in blood."" Akar was taken to Broward North Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, according to the Miami Herald.
Vickery, who is from Palm Beach, told police he often stayed at his girlfriend's home, and that she told him that someone kept watching her through her windows, and that he sometimes was at the house when the stalker was lurking outside. As Vickery told detectives his side of the story, he had dried blood all over him and an ice pack on his foot that was also blood-stained.
On the particular night of the beating death, Vickery and Hobi say they were in bed when they heard a scratching noise outside. Police say Vickery ran outside the house barefoot and naked and found Akar standing underneath the bedroom window with his penis out.
The two got into a fight for several minutes while Hobi called the police, who could hear Hobi saying, ""Tori, stop. Tori, that's enough.""
Although Vickery told police he just kicked Akar once and did nothing else, the medical examiner said Akar had several traumatic injuries to his head and torso, and the ME deemed it a homicide.
Vickery was arrested and released on $75,000 bond, and he was awaiting trial for a charge of felony sex battery before he was arrested Thursday for manslaughter.
Hobi said she made multiple calls to local police over the years to report a peeping Tom.
While the headline of this story may seem unique to some, naked Florida people in the news is, well, nothing new-and not even this week.
Just two days ago, WFLA reported on a man in Delray Beach who was naked and jumped aboard a yacht to steal a flag.
Two days before that, a naked man was caught smashing windows and doors of plumbing businesses in Cape Coral.

Terry David Bateman, 45, and Bradley Allen Rowland, 40, were arrested Friday afternoon and face charges of manufacturing methamphetamine and using drug paraphernalia, according to KATV.
It closely resembles the plot of the TV hit show whose central character, Walter White, was a teacher who turned to drug production.
Officials did not say where the professors at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia are alleged to have produced the drugs. However, the investigation coincided with a science lab at the uni being forced to close early last month over reports of an ""undetermined chemical odor,"" officials told the TV station.
Tests found benzyl chloride, a chemical closely monitored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration which can be used to synthesize amphetamines, the station said.
The lab was closed for three weeks while the university's environmental service company used scrubber systems to filter air and temporarily removed windows to help with ventilation, officials told the station.
It finally opened on Oct. 29 after third-party testing showed the building met Environmental Protection Agency standards.
The two professors were put on administrative leave on Oct. 1. They were arrested Friday afternoon by Clark County Sheriff's Department, the force confirmed to the station.
Both are expected to appear in Clark County District Court once a formal charging decision is made by the prosecutor, the sheriff's department said, according to CNN.

Two Arkansas professors have been accused of making meth at their school.


Henderson State University chemistry professors Terry David Bateman, 45, and Bradley Allen Rowland, 40, in Arkadelphia, Ark., were arrested Friday and face charges of manufacturing methamphetamine and using drug paraphernalia, Clark County Sheriff Jason Watson said in a statement.


Both professors were the subject of an investigation that started with the university's chief of police, Watson said.


Bateman and Rowland have been on administrative leave since Oct. 11, three days after reports of an undetermined chemical odor at a university science center, according to a statement by Henderson State University spokeswoman Tina Hall.


Initial testing indicated an elevated presence of benzyl chloride, a chemical that can be used to synthesize meth, in a laboratory, she said. The building's on-call environmental service company closed the building for remediation work. The building opened its doors again Oct. 29 after third-party testing showed that it met all recommendations for occupancy.


""The safety of our students, faculty, and staff is a top priority, and we continue to cooperate with authorities,"" she said.


The Henderson State University chief of police could not immediately be reached for comment about the initial investigation.


Clark County District Court Judge Randy Hill will schedule first appearances for Bateman and Rowland pending a formal charging decision by Clark County Prosecutor Dan Turner, according to Watson. The investigation is ongoing, he said.


Bateman, an associate professor and director of undergraduate research, has been with the university for 10 years. Rowland has been there since 2014.


Bateman and Rowland did not respond to requests for comment. It is unclear if they have legal representation.


Manufacturing methamphetamine is a felony that could carry a sentence of up to 40 years in prison. A conviction of using drug paraphernalia could mean up to 20 years in prison, according to the Arkansas-based law firm Huffman Butler.

An undercover sting operation in Bellevue led to the arrest of 12 men who police say were soliciting sex online. In just two days, 66 men responded to ads posted by detectives on popular prostitution websites.
As each of the 12 suspects arrived at a hotel - including one who came in a Ferrari - law enforcement was waiting for them, according to the Bellevue Beat Blog.
Seattle council 'shocked' over deputy chief's prostitution statement Captain Dave Sanabria hopes that the operation will send a message to those heading to Bellevue.
""We want to give people pause that are looking to engage in prostitution, either providing prostitution services in the city of Bellevue or trying to patronize,"" he said. ""We wanted to send a very clear message that we don't want men to come to the city of Bellevue to patronize prostitutes.""
Police bust prostitution operations across Kitsap with military connections He says more stings are planned in the near future. Of the 12 who were arrested, only one man was from Bellevue. The others drove in from surrounding cities, and one man was on a business trip from Georgia.
""Just know that there's a very good chance that the person you're communicating with at the other side of that text, at the other side of that call, could likely be a police detective who's waiting to take you into custody for patronizing a prostitute,"" he added.

35,en,Bellevue Police arrest 12 men in prostitution sting,"
BELLEVUE, Wash. - Bellevue Police Department detectives arrested 12 men as part of an undercover prostitution sting. This was a two-day sting and the men were arrested at a hotel in the city.
Police said that overall, 66 men responded to a Bellevue vice detective's fake ad on a known prostitution website.
A thirteenth man would have been arrested if that person didn't get lost finding the hotel, Bellevue police said.
Of the 12 that were arrested, one man was from Bellevue, many were from neighboring cities and one man from Georgia responded to the ad.
According to Bellevue Police, prostitution is appealing because the city is affluent, there are many hotels, and it's close proximity to the freeway. Bellevue Police's message is to make it not appealing at all.
""Our goal is to make prostitution not appealing in the city of Bellevue,"" said Bellevue Police Capt. Dave Sanabria. ""We want people who are looking to establish or are trying to make these dates, to stop and think for a moment that the other person at the end of the line, the end of the ad, or the end of that cell phone, that text, could be a detective waiting for them to take them into custody.""
Soliciting a prostitute is a misdemeanor in Bellevue.
Along with pursuing charges, the city prosecutor now recommends that those accused attend a ten-week program called ""Stopping Sexual Exploitation."" The program is a collaboration among the police department, the city's prosecutor's office and an organization called 'Seattle Against Slavery.'
According to Sanabria, the program has been successful elsewhere.
""I think it's an opportunity for these men to really take a hard look at what they're doing and what their role is. Prostitution isn't a victimless crime. A lot of times, these women, they're not in this particular field on their own volition. They're also victims of other crimes. Rape, robbery, aggravated assault,"" said Sanabria.
There have been other instances of prostitution and sex trafficking in Bellevue. In July, police arrested a 36-year-old woman for making an upscale brothel that was in the city's downtown.
Bellevue's Vice Unit has also been proactive in getting victims help. They recently posted on a known prostitution chat forum, specifically reaching out to sex trafficking victims, reminding them that help is out there.

A Seattle police captain has been arrested on suspicion of sexual exploitation after he was caught up in his department's undercover prostitution operation.
Randal Woolery was arrested on Thursday at 12:23 a.m. and released less than 30 minutes later, according to King County jail records.
Seattle Municipal Court documents show the 53 year old was arrested on suspicion of sexual exploitation, and no complaint was filed by the Seattle City Attorney's Office. Woolery was not charged. Sexual exploitation is known as patronizing a prostitute in other parts of Washington state.
Sergeant Sean Whitcomb said in a statement, according to The Seattle Times, that a 53-year-old Seattle Police Department employee was arrested on Thursday ""in an undercover Vice operation in North Seattle.""
Whitcomb said the worker was jailed with a request for misdemeanor charges. The Office of Police Accountability was notified, and the staff member was assigned to the Professional Standards Bureau and put on administrative leave. 
He described the employee as a ""veteran"" who had worked with the force for 31 years.
Dan Nolte, a spokesman for City Attorney Pete Holmes, told The Seattle Times the case was passed to the office's review and filing unit.
According to Kiro7, Woolery reviewed the use of force for the Seattle Police Department's Professional Standards Bureau, and was Fire Commissioner in Snohomish County Fire District 7. A source in the police department told the broadcaster Woolery was recently given an award for being an inspirational leader. 
In 2015, Seattle changed its terminology from patronizing a prostitute to sexual exploitation, as the City Attorney's Office viewed the latter term as demeaning to people who work in the sex industry.
Sexual exploitation is a misdemeanor in the state of Washington. A person can be accused of the crime if they pay a person or a third party to engage in sexual conduct, or if they solicit a request from an individual to engage in a sex act for a fee. 
The offence is punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, as well as any additional costs and fees.
According to the Dellino Law Group: ""There can be very significant real life consequences associated with these charges, including impact on immigration status, on one's current job, background checks and future employment potential, family life, housing, and more.""

A Pennsylvania couple is accused of theft after going on a shopping spree with $120,000 that was mistakenly deposited into their bank account, according to a report.
Robert Williams and his wife, Tiffany Williams, appeared in court Tuesday after they spent two and a half weeks blowing through most of their accidental windfall on expenses such as cars, bills and a camper, news station WNEP reported.
Robert, 36, and his 35-year-old wife were arraigned on charges of theft and receiving stolen property.
State police said BB&T Bank deposited the dough into the couple's account on May 31 due to a clerical error by a bank teller.
But by June 19, the pair had spent six figures on purchases that included an SUV, two four-wheelers and a car trailer.
They also allegedly used the money for bills, car repairs, cash purchases, as well as gave $15,000 for friends, WNEP reported.
On June 20, the bank contacted Tiffany about the mistake - and to notify her that the money had been taken out of the account, resulting in a $107,416 overdraft fee, the Williamsport Sun-Gazette reported.
She told the bank that she ""would speak to her husband and attempt to construct a repayment agreement,"" police said.
But when the couple went dark on the bank, authorities were contacted to help recoup the stolen money.
Robert admitted to investigators in late July that he and his wife had known the ""mislaid money did not belong to them, but they spent it anyway,"" the newspaper reported.

None of those who were sprayed suffered life-threatening injuries, according to the report. Only two of the injured suffered serious burns.
CHINESE MAN KILLS 8 CHILDREN IN ATTACK ON FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL: POLICE Police said the motive for the bizarre incident was Kong's desire to seek revenge on society, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
His victims went to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, according to the reports. Only two of the injuries were described as serious.
MAN ARRESTED AFTER 20 CHILDREN INJURED IN CHINESE PRIMARY SCHOOL ATTACK The South Morning China Post quoted government officials as saying the suspect bought the chemical substance online.

A man sprayed a corrosive chemical inside a kindergarten in southwest China, injuring 51 students and three teachers, according to the official state news agency.
The attack, which took place Monday afternoon in the Yunnan Province city of Kaiyuan, left two people with serious injuries that were not considered life-threatening, according to the Xinhua news service.
An hour after the attack, the police detained a 23-year-old man, whose surname they gave as Kong. The authorities said he sprayed the chemical, called caustic soda, ""as a revenge on society,"" Xinhua reported.
Caustic soda, also known as sodium hydroxide, can be a colorless to white substance appearing as flakes, beads or a granular form, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The substance can cause irritation to the eyes, burns to the skin and a temporary loss of hair.

More than 50 children were taken to the hospital Tuesday after a deranged man seeking ""revenge on society"" broke into a kindergarten in southwest China and attacked them with sodium hydroxide, a highly corrosive chemical also known as caustic soda, according to multiple reports.


Two students suffered serious burns while three teachers and 48 other children sustained minor to moderate injuries, the South China Morning Post reported.


The 23-year-old man, who was arrested minutes after the attack, invaded the school by cutting wires and climbing into a wall, the Hong Kong-based newspaper said. The horrific incident happened around 3:30 p.m. in Kaiyuan, a city in Yunnan province.


The suspect's motive was not immediately clear, but authorities told local media that he apparently cited a desire to retaliate against society.


Sodium hydroxide can cause irritation or burns to the eyes and skin, though the level of harm depends on the dose and duration of exposure, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The chemical is typically used to make soaps, explosives, paper and other products.


Tuesday's attack comes just two months after eight students were stabbed to death inside an elementary school in central China.

BEIJING - More than 50 people, almost all of them young children, were hospitalized in southwest China Tuesday after a man broke into a kindergarten and sprayed them with a corrosive chemical as ""revenge on society.""
Fifty-one children and three teachers were injured in the attack in Kaiyuan, in Yunnan province, local authorities said. Two were seriously injured, but their injuries were not life-threatening, according to a report from Xinhua news agency.
A 23 year-old with the family name of Kong was later arrested on suspicion of being the assailant, who climbed the wall of the kindergarten and sprayed those inside with sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda.
Sodium hydroxide, which is used to make products including soaps and explosives, is very corrosive and can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes, as well as eye and skin burns, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The level of harm depends upon the dose and duration of exposure it said.
Kaiyuan police said that Kong, who was found at the back of the kindergarten after the attack, had a troubled family background.
""His parents divorced during his childhood and the lack of family warmth resulted in psychological distortion, plus his work and life was unsatisfactory, which created a pessimistic mentality and thoughts about retaliating against society,"" the police said in a statement on their WeChat social media account.
There are no school shootings in China because of extremely strict gun control laws, but there has been a spate of attacks, usually with knives, in recent years.
A man killed eight elementary school students and injured two others on the first day back at school in Hubei province in September.

67,en,5 Smart Ways to Master Winter Style,"
From bold hues and tactile yarns to expressive typography, knitwear has undergone a style metamorphosis. But taking these looks from catwalk to bracing stroll requires practical consideration. Brave the front with our guide to wrapping up warm this winter without losing your cool.
Roll Up
Rollnecks were a staplein the '60s and '70s and are now back in the style limelight once again - largely due to the pique in interest with all things retro. But the versatility of this simple-yet-sleek design should not be underestimated. ""Rollnecks are a great alternative to a classic work shirt. You can wear a fine-gauge style under a suit or with a blazer, while a chunkier knit removes the need to wear a tailored jacket in the first place,"" says David Aquilina, head of menswear at Harvey Nichols. ""Layer up or go one size bigger to tap into a bit of '90s grunge - office rules permitting, naturally."" Our standout roll-up looks? Take a tip from Steve McQueen in 1968's Bullitt and pair a navy rollneck with a tailored Harris Tweed jacket, or for something a bit more forward-thinking, layer a robust multi-hued ombré style under a hardy duffle coat.
The New-Age Tuck
When you think of 'tucking in' as a look, images of sepia-tinted shots of your granddad on holiday in Bognor Regis circa 1951 - or, more recently, Simon Cowell - might spring to mind. But trust us when we say that the tuck is coming back and when deployed intelligently, it can strike that perfect middle ground between raffish and cool. ""The key is not to make it look too contrived. If you're going to do it, commit to it and go full tuck,"" says Daniel Todd, buyer at Mr Porter. 
""I was never a fan of the half-tuck that became a trend last season. Doing it properly also has the satisfying effect of making you look more streamlined."" Our advice? Make sure you watch the volume of your knit - it should be fine enough to sit neatly inside the waistband. Steer clear of chunky jumpers, unless the look you're going for is excess rolls, of course.
Sporting Woolens
You're probably aware that sportswear has left the gym and found its way into the urban wardrobe. While this isn't a new phenomenon, the way in which 'athleisure' is being styled for AW17 is. This season, it's all about polishing up the look with sophisticated knits. ""When donning sportswear for public life, there's a fine line between looking like you've just rolled out of bed and aimed for the sofa, and appearing destined for the front door,"" says Aquilina. 
""This being the case, a cashmere cable knit or a fine-gauge rollneck teamed with tailored track pants and a pair of box-fresh tennis sneakers is a failsafe combination."" So, the takeaway here? Pair elegant knits and clean-cut accessories with relaxed leisurewear to keep things smart enough for both town and country. Keeping some trainer wipes to hand isn't a bad idea, either.
Statement Knits
Sloganeering tends to polarise opinion, and the style world certainly has a love-hate relationship with it. Whatever your standpoint, this season sees a glut of designers translating the look for knitwear and, when approached in the right way, it can add a welcome hit of personality to an often unremarkable winter line-up. ""Fashion is often accused of taking itself too seriously, so this is a good opportunity to inject a sense of fun into your wardrobe,"" says Todd. ""Avoid anything too political and look for something more light-hearted such as Raf Simons' AW17 'I love you' knitwear, which could feasibly have been inspired by that jumper your grandma gave you for Christmas 1989."" But this is no slight - in fact, the vintage jumper reference is actually a compliment, given that '80s and '90s styling is bang on the money at the moment.
Textural Medley
As men, we tend to lack the rich variety found in the wardrobes of our female counterparts, which means we need to be all the more inventive with what we do have. Mixing different textures in an outfit is an easy way to switch things up from the norm. ""Take the rough with the smooth,"" advises Men's Health style director Eric Down. ""Juxtapose a coarse arran jumper with a silky John Smedley number, or try a corduroy or denim jacket with a knit in a tactile long-fibre yarn, such as mohair or alpaca. ""And if you're already mixing textures then you can stick to one colour palette or mix poppier colours with neutrals such as tan, grey or cream to avoid sensory overload."" For the uninitiated, mohair is derived from goats and, like alpaca, is prized for its cloud-soft handle. It's not just sheep that count.

68,,Corrupt Chinese official found with £520million worth of gold bullion in home,"
Police found £520million worth of gold hidden in a Chinese official's home during an anti-corruption raid, reports say.
Detectives also reportedly discovered an astonishing £30billion in suspected bribes in the bureaucrat's bank account, which would make him the richest man in China.
Zhang Qi, 58, has been sacked from his position as secretary of the Communist Party Committee in Haikou - a city of around nine million people in Hainan province.
Footage of police allegedly counting piles of gold bars in the official's home has gone viral on social media, although red-faced Chinese censors have banned the clip.
Qi is under investigation by China's corruption watchdog as part of President Xi Jinping's crackdown on graft, the Mail Online reports.
The President previously said more than a million officials and dozens of former senior bureaucrats had been jailed for corruption since he launched he campaign.
He warned the campaign would never end as corruption was the ""gravest threat"" the party faces.
China came 87th on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2018.
By comparison, the UK ranked 11th, the US 22nd and Denmark 1st.
A Transparency International statement on China, from 2014, said: ""Despite the fact that there has been a widespread information campaign to  denounce corruption and teach integrity , there is  a legitimate concern  about how the Communist Party's war on corruption is being waged.
""There is a lack of independence of the judiciary, a lack of clarity on what constitutes corruption, and a lack of transparency in the process of prosecuting wrongdoing.""
The richest man in China is Ma Huateng, a Chinese business magnate who founded the technology firm Tencent.
He is worth over £30billion, according to Forbes.
