0,,Video sparks fears Hong Kong protesters being... | Taiwan News,"
 TAIPEI (Taiwan News) - A video that surfaced on Monday (Nov. 18) appearing to show Hong Kong protesters being loaded onto a train near the border with China has sparked fears online that they are being sent to a detention center in the communist country.
As clashes continued on a university campus between riot police and pro-democracy protesters, a video was posted on Twitter spurring concerns that arrested demonstrators were being illegally extradited to China. At 2:33 p.m. on Monday, Twitter user @Woppa1Woppa posted a video showing handcuffed protesters being forced onto a train and wrote that it was unknown where they were being sent.
Below the Tweet, several netizens identified the train as belonging to the East Rail Line of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. Although the detainees' destination is unknown, netizens pointed out that the last two stations are Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau, which are both border checkpoints into China.
Twitter users suggested that the students were from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which was the scene of fierce clashes between riot police and pro-democracy protesters on Monday. One Twitter user, who goes by the handle @lilisuricate, ominously said that there are no Hong Kong police stations near any of the stops along the train's route to the China border.
The youth activist group Demosisto wrote on Twitter that people in North District ""threw objects on the railway track"" to prevent the protesters from being transported to China. Hong Kong police have yet to issue an official statement on the destination of the arrested demonstrators.

At 12:34 p.m. on Monday, the Facebook group ""Clear Voices from the Island"" (港島你明) uploaded a post which included several photos of apparent protesters allegedly being loaded onto the train. The author of the post then writes that there is a high-resolution photo of a train originating from Hung Hom Station taken at 12:01 p.m. and showing people in handcuffs being led onboard.
The post first gives the time 12:23 p.m. and says ""Mong Kok East Station."" It then states at 12:28 that two vans in the ""upper left [of photo]"" have the license plate numbers VF7046 and AM2837.
The author then requests anyone who recognizes the detainees in the photo to contact the page's administrator.

2,en,'Intolerably offensive': Boy's Nazi costume at elementary school Halloween parade sparks outrage,"
A photo taken of a child wearing a Nazi costume Thursday during a Halloween parade at Creekside Elementary School in Utah. (KTVX/Screengrab via) The student wore a dark brown dress shirt tucked into tan pants with a black tie and matching dress shoes. Had that been the extent of the boy's outfit, he probably wouldn't have drawn much attention as he walked alongside his costumed peers during a Halloween parade at an elementary school in Utah.

But the child's ensemble featured two eye-catching details: a fake toothbrush mustache and a red armband decorated with a hand-drawn black swastika.


Pictures of the student wearing the Nazi costume and sporting Adolf Hitler's distinctive facial hair at Creekside Elementary School, about 20 miles north of Salt Lake City, were shared on social media last week, sparking intense backlash from critics who decried the boy's attire as "" intolerably offensive."" Now, the school's principal and a teacher have been placed on paid administrative leave, and the school district has launched an investigation into ""every aspect of the situation,"" according to a statement emailed to The Washington Post late Sunday.


""The Davis School District apologizes for what took place Thursday at Creekside Elementary,"" the statement said. ""It does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form."" 


Officials with the district, who did not name the principal or the teacher, noted the matter is being taken ""very seriously."" 


A photo showing the boy's costume was first posted to Facebook by a mother of another child who attends the elementary school, according to Deseret News. In a caption, the mother wrote that the boy had also raised the Nazi salute ""in the face of the few minority children who attend the school,"" Deseret News reported. Creekside Elementary School in Kaysville, Utah, serves more than 750 students from preschool to sixth grade.


""This is something that offended a number of people, frightened people, traumatized people to see it,"" Jay Jacobson, who sits on the United Jewish Federation of Utah's board of trustees, told KTVX.


One mother told KSTU that parents at the Halloween parade were confused and surprised the boy had been permitted to dress as a Nazi. The mother added the boy had targeted her son and other children of color on the playground at recess by ""throwing the 'Hail Hitler' sign up."" 


""The fact that it was at a school, he had to have been seen by his teacher, by multiple people,"" said the mother, who was not identified.


She later called the school to complain and was informed the boy had been taken out of the parade and told to change and his parents had been contacted, KSTU reported. But the mother said the school's explanation for the incident didn't sit well with her.


""I was told they thought he was Charlie Chaplin,"" she told the news station, ""and I'm like, he has a whole swastika on his arm."" 


In a statement shared to Facebook on Saturday, the United Jewish Federation of Utah wrote it was ""appalled"" by the boy's attire, stressing that school districts and administrators ""have an obligation to provide guidance to students and parents about what would be an unacceptable costume for such a school parade."" 


""Almost all Jews and Americans regard Hitler and Nazi symbols as signifiers of the worst hatred, racism, and crimes against humanity that the world has known,"" the statement said. ""Dressing a child as Hitler is intolerably offensive and should never be suggested, permitted, or condoned."" 

A father who 'loves history' donned a Nazi uniform for Halloween - and dressed his 5-year-old as Hitler 

Other social media users were equally outraged. One person called out any adults who saw the boy in costume and let him continue to wear it, writing, ""shame on you!"" Another took issue with the school district's decision to suspend the principal and teacher with pay, tweeting, ""It should be 'Fired on the spot and banned from working in schools again.'""

Incidents of anti-Semitism in the United States went up 57 percent between 2016 and 2017, according to a recent report from the Anti-Defamation League. The dramatic rise - the second-highest number reported since the ADL started tracking such data in 1979 - is largely attributed to a ""significant increase"" in cases in schools or on college campuses, the report said.

Nazi salutes and a swastika made of red cups: Newport Beach students condemned for 'abhorrent anti-Semitic activity' 

The Utah boy's costume isn't the first time Nazi imagery has recently shown up at an elementary school in the United States. In May, a Tennessee school announced that it would stop having a student portray Hitler and perform the Nazi salute as part of a fifth-grade class project on World War II, HuffPost reported. The change came after a student complained about the gesture, which some of her peers started doing outside of class, according to BuzzFeed News. More recently, police in Battle Creek, Mich., launched an investigation after a Nazi flag was spotted in September outside Riverside Elementary School, CNN reported.


The Creekside Elementary School mother who spoke to KSTU said she found the boy's clothing and alleged targeting of minority students, including her son, ""completely inappropriate."" 


""Hitler is hurtful,"" the mother said. ""It's hurtful to people. It's a horrible part of the world's past, so it shouldn't be glorified at all.""

 The principal and a teacher at a Kaysville elementary school were suspended with pay after allowing a student to dress in a Nazi costume in a Halloween parade.
 The image of the child - dressed in tan pants and a brown shirt with a red arm band adorned with a black swastika - began circulating on social media after the Thursday parade at Creekside Elementary. Many commenters expressed outrage at whoever allowed the child to wear the costume, while others supported the boy.
 In a statement, the Davis County School District apologized for the costume.
 ""[The district] does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form,"" the statement read. ""The district is taking the matter very seriously and is investigating every aspect of the situation.""
 School district spokesman Chris Williams declined to name the faculty members who were placed on paid leave, but the elementary school's website lists Steve B. Hammer as the principal.
 The school hosts kindergarten through sixth grade students.
 Schools in the district have faced criticism this year for alleged racism and religious insensitivity. 
 A teacher at Valley View Elementary School in Bountiful was disciplined in March when she asked a fourth grade student, who is Catholic, to remove an ash cross from his forehead on Ash Wednesday.

5,en,Man arrested for killing Peeping Tom in Fort Lauderdale,"
  
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - A man accused of killing a Peeping Tom for looking through the window of his girlfriend's house in Fort Lauderdale in 2018 has been arrested.
Police arrested him on a warrant Thursday.
In early July 2018, Delray Beach resident Victor Vickery, 30, was spending the night at his girlfriend's house at 2100 block of Northeast 61st court when they noticed someone looking through her bedroom window.
According to an arrest report, Vickery's girlfriend, Samantha Hobi, had previously reported several instances of a suspicious person on her property.
Police said while Hobi called 911, Vickery went outside and confronted the man, starting a fight that ended with Vickery beating him to death with a shovel, his fists and his feet.
Fort Lauderdale Police found the Peeping Tom, identified as 57-year-old Asaad Akar, dead and covered in blood when they arrived.
Upon the State Attorney's Office review of the case conducted by detectives, prosecutors determined they had sufficient evidence to charge Vickery with manslaughter.
Vickery is currently being held on $100,000 bond.

6,en,Delray man arrested in 2018 'peeping Tom' killing,"
The Delray Beach man was arrested at work in Boca Raton this week on a manslaughter charge in the 2018 beating death of Asaad Akar in Fort Lauderdale.
BOCA RATON - A Delray Beach man charged in the 2018 beating death of a ""peeping Tom"" was arrested Monday afternoon at his workplace in Boca Raton, police records show.
Victor Van Vickery II is accused of fatally beating 57-year-old Asaad Akar late July 2, 2018, outside the Fort Lauderdale home of Vickery's girlfriend.
Boca Raton police records indicate that Broward County Sheriff's Office authorities tracked the 30-year-old to the call center in Boca Raton where he was working.
Sheriff's authorities alerted Boca Raton police because the office sits in the city's jurisdiction northwest of the intersection of Glades Road and Dixie Highway.
Vickery was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. Monday and booked into the Palm Beach County Jail on an out-of-county warrant, records show. He was transferred to a Broward County jail on Thursday where he is being held on in lieu of $100,000 bail on a manslaughter charge.
Fort Lauderdale police records indicate that Vickery's girlfriend called 911 shortly before midnight July 2, 2018, to report that a suspicious person was peering in her window - again. She had made multiple reports to police over several years about somebody coming into her property and looking through her windows, she told the dispatcher.
Her boyfriend was fighting with the man outside and trying to hold him down until police arrived, she said.
During the 3-minute call she is heard saying ""Tory, stop. Tory, that's enough,"" according to police records. The arrest report indicates that the woman referred to Vickery as ""Tory.""
Vickery told city police that when they heard scratching on a window in his girlfriend's bedroom, he ran outside the back sliding-glass door and saw Akar with his pants unzipped in the fenced-in yard. Records indicate that Akar lived about a 2-minute walk from the woman's home.
Vickery said Akar lunged at him and the two began fighting. Vickery, who was not wearing clothes, said he was afraid for his safety, so he kicked and punched the man.
Officers noted that Vickery's foot was swollen and bloodied. He had dried blood elsewhere on his body as well, records state.
Broward authorities filed the manslaughter charge against Vickery on Sept. 30. It was not clear Friday why they waited to charge Vickery, although it appears that his girlfriend at the time went to police in July of this year and recanted her initial statement in which she said she also hit Akar when they spotted him outside her bedroom window. She said Vickery told her to tell police that she hit Akar with a shovel.
Records indicate that months after Akar's death, that woman filed a restraining order against Vickery, which eventually was dropped. In August 2018 he was arrested for reportedly raping a woman, whom redacted court records identify only as his former girlfriend. It is unclear whether she is the same woman who called 911 the night Akar was killed. That case remains open.
Police noted in their report that Akar had been accused of ""peeping into windows"" of other homes and indicated that he has ""a previous history of arrests for doing the same,"" though details of those cases were not available Friday.
In an online obituary for Akar, who died shortly after 1:30 a.m. July 3, 2018, the Fort Lauderdale resident is remembered as a ""devoted son ... and a kind soul, who was generous with his time and knowledge to all that needed him.""

More than a year later, Vickery has been arrested and charged and is now being held behind bars on a $100,000 bond while he awaits trial.
According to a police report, Vickery and his girlfriend Samantha Hobi were getting intimate in the bedroom of her Fort Lauderdale home when the couple heard a scratching noise coming from outside their window.
Vickery claimed he saw Akar exposed outside of the window when he went outside. 
He told police that he had called authorities to report a peeping Tom in the past. 
Police said Hobi called the cops as the men were fighting and can be heard on the recording of that three-minute call repeatedly saying, 'Tori stop. Tori that's enough.' 
Vickery told police that Akar had lunged at him, got on top of him and began choking him.
He also said that he he kicked Akar and punched him 'a handful of times,' according to the report. 
When Akar tried to run, Vickery chased him and held him down, he told investigators.
When police arrived Vickery had dried blood on his hands and body and his right foot was bloodied and swollen. 
Akar, who lived around the corner from Hobi, was taken to Broward Health North hospital in Deerfield Beach. 
He died at the hospital within two hours from blunt force trauma to his head and torso.

Two associate chemistry professors were arrested Friday for allegedly manufacturing meth at an Arkansas university chemistry lab.
Dr. Terry Bateman, 45, and Dr. Bradley Rowland, 40, are facing charges of manufacture of methamphetamine and use of drug paraphernalia after an investigation at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, according to the Clark County Sheriff's Office.
""Bateman and Rowland were the subject of an investigation originating with Henderson State University Chief of Police, Johnny Campbell,"" the sheriff's office said in a press release.
The investigation was then picked up by the sheriff's office along with the Arkadelphia police and a narcotics task force.
The university said in a statement that the two men were placed on leave on Oct. 11 after an investigation of a chemical odor three days prior. Initial testing indicated an elevated presence of benzyl chloride in a laboratory, the school said.
Benzyl chloride has been identified by government agencies as a chemical used in the production of methamphetamine.
Bateman and Rowland are expected to appear in court pending a formal charge decision by the Clark County Prosecutor, according to KARK. It is unclear if they have a lawyer or still in custody.

Two chemistry professors in Arkansas are accused of making methamphetamine in a lab at their school.
According to a statement from the Clark county sheriff, Jason Watson, Terry David Bateman and Bradley Allen Rowland, of Henderson State University, were arrested and charged with manufacturing meth and use of drug paraphernalia.
The case gained international attention thanks to its echoes of the hit TV series Breaking Bad, in which Bryan Cranston played Walter White, a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher who made and sold meth on the side.
A spokeswoman for the college in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, said in a statement the two professors had been on administrative leave since 11 October, shortly after an undetermined chemical odour was detected at a university science centre.
The centre was closed for three weeks, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. It reopened after a test confirmed it met Environmental Protection Agency standards regarding air quality.
The college spokeswoman said an investigation was ongoing.
The charges facing the professors carry sentences of up to 40 years, for making meth, and up to 20 years for use of drug paraphernalia. Topics

15,en,Bellevue Police arrest 12 men in prostitution sting,"
BELLEVUE, Wash. - Bellevue Police Department detectives arrested 12 men as part of an undercover prostitution sting. This was a two-day sting and the men were arrested at a hotel in the city.
Police said that overall, 66 men responded to a Bellevue vice detective's fake ad on a known prostitution website.
A thirteenth man would have been arrested if that person didn't get lost finding the hotel, Bellevue police said.
Of the 12 that were arrested, one man was from Bellevue, many were from neighboring cities and one man from Georgia responded to the ad.
According to Bellevue Police, prostitution is appealing because the city is affluent, there are many hotels, and it's close proximity to the freeway. Bellevue Police's message is to make it not appealing at all.
""Our goal is to make prostitution not appealing in the city of Bellevue,"" said Bellevue Police Capt. Dave Sanabria. ""We want people who are looking to establish or are trying to make these dates, to stop and think for a moment that the other person at the end of the line, the end of the ad, or the end of that cell phone, that text, could be a detective waiting for them to take them into custody.""
Soliciting a prostitute is a misdemeanor in Bellevue.
Along with pursuing charges, the city prosecutor now recommends that those accused attend a ten-week program called ""Stopping Sexual Exploitation."" The program is a collaboration among the police department, the city's prosecutor's office and an organization called 'Seattle Against Slavery.'
According to Sanabria, the program has been successful elsewhere.
""I think it's an opportunity for these men to really take a hard look at what they're doing and what their role is. Prostitution isn't a victimless crime. A lot of times, these women, they're not in this particular field on their own volition. They're also victims of other crimes. Rape, robbery, aggravated assault,"" said Sanabria.
There have been other instances of prostitution and sex trafficking in Bellevue. In July, police arrested a 36-year-old woman for making an upscale brothel that was in the city's downtown.
Bellevue's Vice Unit has also been proactive in getting victims help. They recently posted on a known prostitution chat forum, specifically reaching out to sex trafficking victims, reminding them that help is out there.

22,en,Police: Couple charged after spending more than $100K the bank accidentally gave them,"


MONTOURSVILLE, Pa. (WNEP/CNN) - A couple in Pennsylvania is facing theft charges and more than $100,000 in overdraft fees after allegedly using money that was accidentally deposited into their bank account.


Investigators say Robert and Tiffany Williams had $120,000 deposited into their account at BB&T on May 31 through a mistake by a teller.


But instead of contacting the bank about the deposit, the couple allegedly spent the next two-and-a-half weeks using most of the money.


""That is kind of shocking,"" neighbor Nate Weaver said. ""With all the procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, there's no way anybody gets away with that stuff.""


State police say the couple bought an SUV, two four-wheelers, a camper and car trailer. A police report said they used the money on bills, car repairs, cash purchases and even gave $15,000 to friends in need of money.


""I would check in with the bank first before I did anything,"" said Robert Painton, another neighbor. ""I'm not that dumb, but some people do stupid things sometimes.""


Once the bank realized its mistake, it transferred the $120,000 to the correct account.


It contacted Tiffany Williams on June 20 and told her the couple had to pay back the $107,000 in overdraft fees they incurred.


On June 21, the bank called again. Mrs. Williams said she and her husband would work out a payment plan.


Court papers show after those two initial phone calls from the bank, the couple had no contact with bank representatives, despite several attempts by the bank to reach them.


The couple is now facing felony theft charges. They were released on $25,000 bail.

Robert Williams, 36, and his wife Tiffany, 35, of Pennsylvania were arrested after spending nearly $120,000 of stolen money after a bank teller accidentally deposited the wrong amount into their account
The couple never notified BB&T of the mistake and spent the money on various items, including an SUV, two four-wheelers, a camper and a car trailer
 BB&T realized the mistake two weeks later and contacted the Williams about the misplaced money
 The couple was arraigned in court on Tuesday, facing felony theft charges and receiving stolen property
They were released on $25,000 bail

A Pennsylvania couple is accused of theft after going on an illegal shopping spree because a bank teller mistakenly put more than $100,000 in their account. 
Robert Williams, 36, and Tiffany Williams, 35, reportedly received $120,000 in their bank account after a teller at BB&T accidentally added the money on May 31.   
Instead of notifying the bank, the Montoursville couple blew through the money in two and half weeks, according to WPEN. 
Between June 3 and June 19, the couple purchased an SUV, a camper, a car trailer and two four-wheelers. 
They also reportedly spent the money on bills, car repairs, cash purchases and gave $15,00 to a friend in need. 
Before the large deposit, the Williamsport Sun-Gazette reports the Williams only had $1,121 in their bank account. 
BB&T realized the error around June 20 and transferred the funds to the correct recipient, Dimension Covington Investment LLC. 
By this time the Williams had amassed $107,416 in overdraft fees, according to Williamsport Sun-Gazette. 
The bank contacted Tiffany, explaining that she and her husband were expected to repay all the funds. 
The bank called the couple again on June 21, but Tiffany told them they had spent a vast majority of the money.   
'She no longer had the funds because she had already paid off bills. She told the bank her husband had spent a great portion of the funds and purchased a four-wheeler,' Williamsport Sun-Gazette reported. 
'She said she would speak to her husband and attempt to construct a repayment agreement.'
After that, the bank attempted to contact the couple several times, but were not able to reach them.
After being taken into police custody, the couple told authorities they were aware that the money was not theirs. 
The Williamsport Sun-Gazette reports that Robert said they knew the 'mislaid money did not belong to them, but they spent it anyway.'
Neighbors of the Williams were surprised by the allegations. 
'That is kind of shocking,' neighbor Nate Weaver told WNEP. 'With all the procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, there's no way anybody gets away with that stuff.' 
When asked by WNEP, Robert's father was unable to provide information about his son's case or current situation.  
The Williams were arraigned on Tuesday, facing felony theft charges and receiving stolen property.

","Robert Williams, 36, and his wife Tiffany, 35, of Pennsylvania were arrested after spending nearly $120,000 of stolen money after a bank teller accidentally deposited the wrong amount into their account The couple never notified BB&T of the mistake and spent the money on various items, including an SUV, two",https://www.dailymail.co.uk,"[{'score': 0, 'name': 'dailymail'}, {'score': 0, 'name': 'news'}]",dailymail.co.uk,Mail Online,2040.0,753.0,287.0,1000.0,0,0,2019-09-09,5,10,512,50

Imagine waking up one day to find an extra $120,000 in your bank account. You did not make $120,000 or win $120,000, but there it is, $120,000, just sitting there.


What would you do with all that cash? Pay off the mountain of student loans you'd otherwise be stuck with until you die? Buy a house? Buy a car? Buy this weird-looking rich-people furniture?


Maybe you should call the bank and find out what's going on?


Robert and Tiffany Williams of Montoursville, Pa., did not call the bank, police say.


When a non-hypothetical $120,000 intended for a business was accidentally transferred into their BB&T bank account because of a teller error, the couple splurged on a camper, a Chevy and a racecar, state trooper Aaron Brown told the Williamsport Sun-Gazette. Authorities say they also distributed $15,000 to friends who needed the money.


All told, they spent $100,000 in about 2½ weeks, WNEP reported.


Eventually, though, the bank contacted them on or around June 20 after sending the money to the correct account. The bank notified Tiffany Williams, 35, that they were responsible for returning all the funds, Brown told the Sun-Gazette. He added that the withdrawal resulted in a $107,416 overdraft because the couple's bank account had only $1,121 in it before the accidental windfall.


In an email, BB&T spokesman Brian Davis said that ""while we can't comment on the specifics of this issue due to client privacy practices, we always work as quickly as possible to address any issue that affects our clients. We're also continuously working to enhance our client service and operating procedures to provide the best client experience possible.""


The couple now face three felony charges of theft and receiving stolen property. 


""All I'm going to say is we took some bad legal advice from some people and it probably wasn't the best thing in the end,"" Robert Williams said Monday in court, according to WNEP.


Tiffany first assured the bank she would work out a repayment plan with her husband, but she eventually ceased communications, WNEP reported.


""That is kind of shocking, with all the procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, there's no way anybody gets away with that stuff,"" Nate Weaver, a neighbor of the Williamses, told WNEP.


The Sun-Gazette reported that the couple, in separate interrogations, told police that they ""admitted to knowing the mislaid money did not belong to them, but they spent it anyway.""


The case is now going to trial, WNEP reported.

More than 50 children were taken to the hospital Tuesday after a deranged man seeking ""revenge on society"" broke into a kindergarten in southwest China and attacked them with sodium hydroxide, a highly corrosive chemical also known as caustic soda, according to multiple reports.


Two students suffered serious burns while three teachers and 48 other children sustained minor to moderate injuries, the South China Morning Post reported.


The 23-year-old man, who was arrested minutes after the attack, invaded the school by cutting wires and climbing into a wall, the Hong Kong-based newspaper said. The horrific incident happened around 3:30 p.m. in Kaiyuan, a city in Yunnan province.


The suspect's motive was not immediately clear, but authorities told local media that he apparently cited a desire to retaliate against society.


Sodium hydroxide can cause irritation or burns to the eyes and skin, though the level of harm depends on the dose and duration of exposure, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The chemical is typically used to make soaps, explosives, paper and other products.


Tuesday's attack comes just two months after eight students were stabbed to death inside an elementary school in central China.

BEIJING - More than 50 people, almost all of them young children, were hospitalized in southwest China on Tuesday after a man broke into a kindergarten and sprayed them with a corrosive chemical as ""revenge on society.""


Fifty-one children and three teachers were injured in the attack in Kaiyuan, in Yunnan province, local authorities said. Two were seriously injured, but their injuries were not life-threatening, according to a report from Xinhua news agency.


A 23-year-old with the family name of Kong was later arrested on suspicion of being the assailant who climbed the wall of the kindergarten and sprayed those inside with sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda.


Sodium hydroxide, which is used to make products including soaps and explosives, is very corrosive and can cause irritation to the eyes, skin and mucous membranes, as well as eye and skin burns, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The level of harm depends upon the dose and duration of exposure, the agency said.

Attacker kills seven middle school students in China, wounds another 12 

Kaiyuan police said that Kong, who was found at the back of the kindergarten after the attack, had a troubled family background.


""His parents divorced during his childhood and the lack of family warmth resulted in psychological distortion, plus his work and life was unsatisfactory, which created a pessimistic mentality and thoughts about retaliating against society,"" police said in a statement on their WeChat social media account.


There are no school shootings in China because of strict gun-control laws, but there has been a spate of attacks, usually with knives, in recent years.


A man killed eight elementary school students and injured two others on the first day of school in Hubei province in September.


In separate attacks last year, a woman with a knife slashed 14 children at a kindergarten in the western Chinese city of Chongqing in October, and a man stabbed and killed two children outside an elementary school in Shanghai in June. The man arrested in the stabbing said he wanted ""to take revenge on society.""


In April last year, nine students were killed as they left their middle school in Shaanxi province for the day when a 28-year-old man, apparently seeking revenge for being bullied when he was a student there, went on a stabbing rampage. Ten others were hurt. The man was convicted and executed.

有关爆料目前难以证实
9月6日，官方宣布中共海南省委常委、海口市委书记张琦""涉嫌严重违纪违法""被查，张琦成为中共十九大后落马的海南""首虎""。
张琦被查前毫无预兆，成为被""秒杀""的高官。9月6日《海口日报》头版头条新闻中提到，9月5日，张琦还出席了在海南省人大会堂召开的海南省人才大会。
资料显示，1961年3月出生的张琦是安徽寿县人，曾任海南省三亚市委副书记、副市长、省旅游局局长、儋州市市长等职；2010年2月起任儋州市委书记兼洋浦经济开发区工委副书记；2014年9月兼任海南省委常委，升副省级；2014年10月任海南省委常委、三亚市委书记；2016年11月任海南省委常委、海口市委书记至今。
据不完全统计，习近平上台以来，已有254名副部级（包括副军级）以上官员落马。除67名副军级落马官员的贪腐情况未通报外，已有31名贪官的贪腐金额超过了1亿元（官方口径）。
这些贪官，从村官到正国级都有，其中副厅级的山西吕梁前副市长张中生，贪腐10.4亿余元，另有1.3亿余元财产不能说明来源，贪腐金额超过11亿元。张中生创造了截至目前为止所公布的贪官贪腐金额最高纪录。但陆媒《新京报》援引一位接近山西省检察院的消息人士则称，张中生涉案金额超过25亿元。
事实上，中共对于贪官的贪腐额，似乎越是高官，越会故意缩小金额，故此官报数据与外界传闻反差巨大。
 
中共海口市委书记张琦9月6日被""秒杀""，落马当天还登上了当地官媒的头条新闻
比如，官方称中共前政法委书记周永康涉贪1.3亿元，因滥权造成14.86亿余元的损失；但据路透社报导，周永康家族贪腐近1,000亿元。
北京当局并没有通报67名副军级以上落马官员的贪腐情况，包括两名前军委副主席徐才厚、郭伯雄，中共前军委委员张阳、房峰辉等重量级官员。
据港媒称，有中共军官曾踢爆郭伯雄受贿名单，接受高官的""进贡""已有数百亿元，加上买卖官位及土地等收入，估算不少于千亿元，有媒体形容，一个郭伯雄的涉贪金额就可以挽救两个希腊。
另据报导，徐才厚地下室里到处堆放着现金，办案人员一时点不过来，只好拿秤称了一下，再贴上封条。被查抄的美元、欧元、人民币等现金有1吨多重，另有200公斤和田玉，翡翠、上好翡翠原石、古玩器字画，用十几辆军用卡车才运走。
而徐才厚的名言是：我最大的优点就是廉洁！

 Police have found mountain of 13.5 tons gold and haul of $37 billion in cash in a raid on the home of an allegedly corrupt ex-mayor in China.
Chinese officials came across the incredible mounds of gold bullion while searching his house in Haikou City.
Zhang Qi, a former mayor and member of the Community Party, was undergoing a review by the National Supervisory Commission.
 He will now have even more explaining to do after police uncovered the multi-billion dollar haul in his basement. 
 Evidence was also discovered that he owned a vast portfolio of luxury properties. 
 Officials convicted of ""economic crimes"" face the death penalty in China. 
Video shows investigators sifting through the giant pile of gold bars.
 Some is just stacked on the floor, while other pieces of gold are wrapped in bags on metal shelves. 
The approximate value of a ton of pure gold is around $37,000,000.
 That means the gold haul alone had a value of nearly $500 million. 
Cash found at the property was in various currencies such as dollars, Chinese yuan and euros.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made his fight against corruption a major policy for the Communist Party.
More than 10,000 people have been indicted for corruption since he took office in 2012.
 And reportedly at least 120 high-ranking corrupt officials, including military officers and top executives, have also been uncovered. 
 It has been speculated by some that the campaign is actually a front of a widespread political purge by Xi. 
Meanwhile, today China held a massive military parade as they celebrated the 70th anniversary of the rule of the Communist Party.

A powerful Communist official in China is suspected to have received 13.5 tonnes of gold and £30 billion cash in bribes.
Thousands of golden bars and bricks were discovered at the leader's home during a raid by corruption inspectors earlier this month.
Their value could be worth up to £520 million, according to international trading prices.
Zhang Qi, 58, who was a top official in the province of Hainan has been sacked. 
In addition to the gold, inspectors discovered 268 billion yuan (£30 billion) in suspected bribes on the man's account, according to reports. 
He was also thought to have received multiple luxurious villas as perks. 
If Mr Zhang's alleged corruption turns out to be true, he would have been richer than Jack Ma, the wealthiest man in China worth $37 billion (£30 billion) according to Forbes. 
Mr Zhang was the secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Haikou, the provincial capital city of Hainan with a population around nine million people. 
He had equal power as the city's mayor, according to the ranking of Chinese Communist party officials. 
He was also a member of the Standing Committee of Hainan Province.
He has been stripped of both titles by the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
Footage circulating on Twitter shows one person counting lumps of gold in a room believed to be in Mr Zhang's lavish home. 
The clip and related news have been censored in mainland China. 
In a statement on September 6, the country's corruption watchdog said Mr Zhang was suspected to have seriously violated the law and discipline. 
He is currently under inspection and investigation from the authority. 
Mr Zhang was born in eastern China's Anhui Province and joined the Communist Party in 1983. 
Before ascending to power in Haikou, he served as the deputy mayor of Sanya city and the mayor of Danzhou. Both cities are in Hainan Province.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has launched a tough anti-corruption campaign since he took office in 2012. 
Statistics show at least 53 officials have been caught receiving more than 100 million yuan (£11 million) in bribes in the past seven years in the nation.  
Mr Zhang is the 17th senior official to have been investigated for corruption in China since the beginning of the year, according to Chinese media.

Zhang Qi, 58, has been sacked from his position as secretary of the Communist Party Committee in Haikou - a city of around nine million people in Hainan province.
Footage of police allegedly counting piles of gold bars in the official's home has gone viral on social media, although red-faced Chinese censors have banned the clip.
Qi is under investigation by China's corruption watchdog as part of President Xi Jinping's crackdown on graft, the Mail Online reports.
The President previously said more than a million officials and dozens of former senior bureaucrats had been jailed for corruption since he launched he campaign.
He warned the campaign would never end as corruption was the ""gravest threat"" the party faces.
China came 87th on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2018.
By comparison, the UK ranked 11th, the US 22nd and Denmark 1st.
A Transparency International statement on China, from 2014, said: ""Despite the fact that there has been a widespread information campaign to  denounce corruption and teach integrity , there is  a legitimate concern  about how the Communist Party's war on corruption is being waged.
""There is a lack of independence of the judiciary, a lack of clarity on what constitutes corruption, and a lack of transparency in the process of prosecuting wrongdoing.""
The richest man in China is Ma Huateng, a Chinese business magnate who founded the technology firm Tencent.
He is worth over £30billion, according to Forbes.

45,en,UVA reinstates 21-gun salute on Veterans Day after wide-scale backlash,"
 UPDATE (Nov. 18):
The University of Virginia is reinstating the 21-gun salute for next year's Veterans Day ceremonies.
The Daily Progress reports that the university is reversing its decision to drop the salute. University President Jim Ryan announced the change on Saturday. In a Facebook post, Ryan wrote, ""Sometimes you make mistakes.""
The salute has been part of ROTC ceremonies for at least a decade. It normally occurs at the end of cadets' 24-hour vigil on Veterans Day,
University officials had said the decision to nix the salute was made to avoid disrupting classes. Ryan also cited concerns about national gun violence and firing weapons on campus.
Larry Sabato, director of the university's Center for Politics, tweeted that he was glad Ryan reversed course.

ORIGINAL STORY (Nov. 8):
The University of Virginia is coming under fire over a decision to change a part of its annual Veterans Day ceremony.
The university will still hold a Veterans Day ceremony on Monday, but it will no longer include the 21-gun salute. It's a decision UVA leaders say will not change.
The Provost's office, in conjunction with the colonel of UVA's ROTC program, made the decision. The ceremony marks the conclusion of a 24-hour vigil by ROTC cadets and has included the 21-gun salute for more than a decade.
""One is that it would be disruptive to classes and two, unfortunately with gun violence in the U.S., there was some concern that we would cause a panic if someone heard gunshots on grounds,"" said UVA President Jim Ryan.
Veterans like Jay Levine are upset with the decision. Levine went through the ROTC program at UVA and says the 21-gun salute is the ultimate salute to those who have served and passed away.
""I am very disillusioned, very upset, and very surprised that they would make such a decision,"" Levine said.
Levine says he will write an email to UVA about his concerns. He hopes talking in a more public setting will help entice more veterans to take action.
""Freedom isn't free,"" Levine said. ""There's a cost and that cost is born by the veterans and the families of those veterans.""
UVA spokesperson Brian Coy the university hears and respects the concerns raised by members of the community and will continue to engage in the conversation going forward. Coy says UVA fully supports the solemn observance of Veterans Day.
The 24-hour vigil and Veterans Day ceremony will be held in the McIntire Amphitheatre. It begins at 4 p.m. on Monday, November 11 and will conclude on Tuesday, November 12.

46,,"Citing 'gun violence,' UVA cancels 21-gun salute portion of Veterans Day ceremony | The College Fix","
Citing ""gun violence,"" the University of Virginia has canceled the 21-gun salute portion of its Veterans Day ceremony, an annual tradition that dates back at least a decade.
In a statement posted to social media on Saturday, university President James Ryan stated the reason was two-fold: ""to minimize disruptions to classes, given that this event is located at the juncture of four primary academic buildings and is held at a time that classes are in session; and second, recognizing concerns related to firing weapons on the Grounds in light of gun violence that has happened across our nation, especially on school and university campuses.""
According to the local ABC news affiliate WHSV, the annual ceremony ""marks the conclusion of a 24-hour vigil by ROTC cadets and has included the 21-gun salute for more than a decade,"" but the decision to nix the salute was made by the provost's office in conjunction with the colonel of UVA's ROTC program.
Backlash has been so severe Ryan said the university will revisit the issue in 2020.
""[C]ommunity responses have helped us to understand that many see the 21-gun salute as an important element of the Veterans Day ceremony at the University of Virginia. Given that the plans are already in place for this year, we will follow the event organizers' recommendation to proceed without the 21-gun salute in our Veterans Day Ceremony. Following this year's ceremony, however, we will work with our ROTC officers and cadets to take a closer look at options for our Veterans Day events, including those that would enable us to re-introduce the 21-gun salute to the program,"" Ryan stated.
According to media outlets in Virginia, the decision prompted anger. The Daily Progress, the newspaper in Charlottesville, Virginia, published several letters to the editor lambasting the decision.
One letter argued that the decision disrespected the fact that the university's rotunda hosts plaques honoring hundreds of alumni slain in previous wars. Another argued ""veterans deserve better.""
The decision also sent ""an unfortunate message about students: That they are too fragile, too delicate, too distractible to deal with the 'interruption' of the salute. That they are too insular, too wrapped up in their own worlds to comprehend and accept this longstanding practice. That they must be protected from the reality that exists outside academia,"" another letter writer chimed in.
Some Twitter users responding to Ryan's statement were a little more blunt. Among them: ""How 'we' reached the decision? The buck stops with you. Score one for the snowflakes.""
Tweeted another: ""As a @UVA #UVA student veteran, thank you for marginalizing my community. That is a direct, unmitigated slap in the face to those of us who have served, and especially to those of us who have served and lost. I am deeply sorry that you decided to make this incorrect decision.""
However Ryan garnered some support, too, with one replying ""people forget that rampant mass shootings are commonplace now, so it makes sense not to be firing off guns near classrooms,"" and another noting that ""as a long-ago alumna, I want you to know how much you continue to impress. You do our university and your role proud.""

Click here for a free subscription to weekly Todd's newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives!   He said there were two specific reasons.
""First, to minimize disruptions to classes, given that this event is located at the juncture of four primary academic buildings and is held at a time that classes are in session; and second, recognizing concerns related to firing weapons on the Grounds in light of gun violence that has happened across our nation, especially on school and university campuses,"" the president wrote. 
As you might imagine - the outrage among veterans and military supporters has been severe.
""It also, ironically, sends an unfortunate message about students: That they are too fragile, too delicate, too distractible to deal with the 'interruption' of the salute. That they are too insular, too wrapped up in their own worlds to comprehend and accept this longstanding practice. That they must be protected from the reality that exists outside academia,"" they wrote. 
The blowback was apparently so significant - that President Ryan promised to re-introduce the 21-gun salute next year.
The notion that students might suffer some sort of disruption because the ROTC is honoring our veterans is repulsive. 
""The use of gun salutes for military occasions is traced to early warriors who demonstrated their peaceful intentions by placing their weapons in a position that rendered them ineffective,"" the center explained. ""The 21-gun salute became the highest honor a nation rendered.""
The University of Virginia may think they are protecting their overly sensitive students, but in reality they are disrespecting our veterans.

UVA President Jim Ryan confirmed in a Facebook post that the university will remove the annual 21-gun salute from the end of its Veterans Day events, a tradition that's been a part of the ceremony for more than a decade. 
The provost's office and the colonel of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) decided to eliminate the salute, which was intended to mark the end of a 24-hour vigil by the ROTC. 
""One is that it would be disruptive to classes and two unfortunately with gun violence in the U.S., there was some concern that we would cause a panic if someone heard gunshots on grounds,"" Ryan told NBC29. 
The university is facing some backlash for the salute's cancellation, including from veteran Jay Levine who attended the ROTC program at the university. 
""I am very disillusioned, very upset, and very surprised that they would make such a decision,"" Levine told NBC29. 
University spokesperson Brian Coy told the news outlet that UVA hears and respects the concerns brought up and supports Veterans Day. 
Ryan said in the Facebook post that the 21-gun salute is ""not a required, or even typical"" element of Veterans Day ceremonies. 
""But given that the 21-gun salute is not a required, or even typical, part of Veteran's Day ceremonies - as opposed to Memorial Day ceremonies, which are specifically dedicated to those who have lost their lives in service to our country - they chose to keep the ceremony at a central location on Grounds but leave out the 21-gun salute,"" he wrote.

The University of Virginia has been forced to reconsider its removal of the 21-gun salute from its Veterans Day ceremony after massive backlash from locals, veterans, and even the students the decision was supposed to 'protect.'
UVA ditched the salute, citing concerns it would panic students associating the sound with "" gun violence. "" Faced with a towering backlash, however, university president Jim Ryan has pledged to reconsider the move - for next year.
The decade-old tradition was dropped after what Ryan insists was careful consideration by the university Air Force ROTC commander and the Provost's Office "" to minimize disruptions to classes"" and "" recognizing concerns related to firing weapons on the Grounds in light of gun violence that has happened across our nation, especially on school and university campuses,"" he stated in a Facebook post on Saturday.

Monday's ceremony, however - which starts with a 24-hour vigil by ROTC cadets - would not include the salute.
"" Doesn't matter why you made the decision, it was a stupid one,"" one veteran's daughter posted in response to Ryan's Facebook statement. Most of the replies - many by veterans and UVA alumni - echoed the sentiment, reminding Ryan that soldiers had laid down their lives for his right to virtue-signal.
