0,en,Police: Couple charged after spending more than $100K the bank accidentally gave them,"


MONTOURSVILLE, Pa. (WNEP/CNN) - A couple in Pennsylvania is facing theft charges and more than $100,000 in overdraft fees after allegedly using money that was accidentally deposited into their bank account.


Investigators say Robert and Tiffany Williams had $120,000 deposited into their account at BB&T on May 31 through a mistake by a teller.


But instead of contacting the bank about the deposit, the couple allegedly spent the next two-and-a-half weeks using most of the money.


""That is kind of shocking,"" neighbor Nate Weaver said. ""With all the procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, there's no way anybody gets away with that stuff.""


State police say the couple bought an SUV, two four-wheelers, a camper and car trailer. A police report said they used the money on bills, car repairs, cash purchases and even gave $15,000 to friends in need of money.


""I would check in with the bank first before I did anything,"" said Robert Painton, another neighbor. ""I'm not that dumb, but some people do stupid things sometimes.""


Once the bank realized its mistake, it transferred the $120,000 to the correct account.


It contacted Tiffany Williams on June 20 and told her the couple had to pay back the $107,000 in overdraft fees they incurred.


On June 21, the bank called again. Mrs. Williams said she and her husband would work out a payment plan.


Court papers show after those two initial phone calls from the bank, the couple had no contact with bank representatives, despite several attempts by the bank to reach them.


The couple is now facing felony theft charges. They were released on $25,000 bail.

1,en,Bellevue Police arrest 12 men in prostitution sting,"
BELLEVUE, Wash. - Bellevue Police Department detectives arrested 12 men as part of an undercover prostitution sting. This was a two-day sting and the men were arrested at a hotel in the city.
Police said that overall, 66 men responded to a Bellevue vice detective's fake ad on a known prostitution website.
A thirteenth man would have been arrested if that person didn't get lost finding the hotel, Bellevue police said.
Of the 12 that were arrested, one man was from Bellevue, many were from neighboring cities and one man from Georgia responded to the ad.
According to Bellevue Police, prostitution is appealing because the city is affluent, there are many hotels, and it's close proximity to the freeway. Bellevue Police's message is to make it not appealing at all.
""Our goal is to make prostitution not appealing in the city of Bellevue,"" said Bellevue Police Capt. Dave Sanabria. ""We want people who are looking to establish or are trying to make these dates, to stop and think for a moment that the other person at the end of the line, the end of the ad, or the end of that cell phone, that text, could be a detective waiting for them to take them into custody.""
Soliciting a prostitute is a misdemeanor in Bellevue.
Along with pursuing charges, the city prosecutor now recommends that those accused attend a ten-week program called ""Stopping Sexual Exploitation."" The program is a collaboration among the police department, the city's prosecutor's office and an organization called 'Seattle Against Slavery.'
According to Sanabria, the program has been successful elsewhere.
""I think it's an opportunity for these men to really take a hard look at what they're doing and what their role is. Prostitution isn't a victimless crime. A lot of times, these women, they're not in this particular field on their own volition. They're also victims of other crimes. Rape, robbery, aggravated assault,"" said Sanabria.
There have been other instances of prostitution and sex trafficking in Bellevue. In July, police arrested a 36-year-old woman for making an upscale brothel that was in the city's downtown.
Bellevue's Vice Unit has also been proactive in getting victims help. They recently posted on a known prostitution chat forum, specifically reaching out to sex trafficking victims, reminding them that help is out there.

2,,Video sparks fears Hong Kong protesters being... | Taiwan News,"
 TAIPEI (Taiwan News) - A video that surfaced on Monday (Nov. 18) appearing to show Hong Kong protesters being loaded onto a train near the border with China has sparked fears online that they are being sent to a detention center in the communist country.
As clashes continued on a university campus between riot police and pro-democracy protesters, a video was posted on Twitter spurring concerns that arrested demonstrators were being illegally extradited to China. At 2:33 p.m. on Monday, Twitter user @Woppa1Woppa posted a video showing handcuffed protesters being forced onto a train and wrote that it was unknown where they were being sent.
Below the Tweet, several netizens identified the train as belonging to the East Rail Line of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. Although the detainees' destination is unknown, netizens pointed out that the last two stations are Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau, which are both border checkpoints into China.
Twitter users suggested that the students were from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which was the scene of fierce clashes between riot police and pro-democracy protesters on Monday. One Twitter user, who goes by the handle @lilisuricate, ominously said that there are no Hong Kong police stations near any of the stops along the train's route to the China border.
The youth activist group Demosisto wrote on Twitter that people in North District ""threw objects on the railway track"" to prevent the protesters from being transported to China. Hong Kong police have yet to issue an official statement on the destination of the arrested demonstrators.

At 12:34 p.m. on Monday, the Facebook group ""Clear Voices from the Island"" (港島你明) uploaded a post which included several photos of apparent protesters allegedly being loaded onto the train. The author of the post then writes that there is a high-resolution photo of a train originating from Hung Hom Station taken at 12:01 p.m. and showing people in handcuffs being led onboard.
The post first gives the time 12:23 p.m. and says ""Mong Kok East Station."" It then states at 12:28 that two vans in the ""upper left [of photo]"" have the license plate numbers VF7046 and AM2837.
The author then requests anyone who recognizes the detainees in the photo to contact the page's administrator.
