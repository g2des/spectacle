0,en,Police: Couple charged after spending more than $100K the bank accidentally gave them,"


MONTOURSVILLE, Pa. (WNEP/CNN) - A couple in Pennsylvania is facing theft charges and more than $100,000 in overdraft fees after allegedly using money that was accidentally deposited into their bank account.


Investigators say Robert and Tiffany Williams had $120,000 deposited into their account at BB&T on May 31 through a mistake by a teller.


But instead of contacting the bank about the deposit, the couple allegedly spent the next two-and-a-half weeks using most of the money.


""That is kind of shocking,"" neighbor Nate Weaver said. ""With all the procedures the banks have set up, checking and double-checking and triple-checking, there's no way anybody gets away with that stuff.""


State police say the couple bought an SUV, two four-wheelers, a camper and car trailer. A police report said they used the money on bills, car repairs, cash purchases and even gave $15,000 to friends in need of money.


""I would check in with the bank first before I did anything,"" said Robert Painton, another neighbor. ""I'm not that dumb, but some people do stupid things sometimes.""


Once the bank realized its mistake, it transferred the $120,000 to the correct account.


It contacted Tiffany Williams on June 20 and told her the couple had to pay back the $107,000 in overdraft fees they incurred.


On June 21, the bank called again. Mrs. Williams said she and her husband would work out a payment plan.


Court papers show after those two initial phone calls from the bank, the couple had no contact with bank representatives, despite several attempts by the bank to reach them.


The couple is now facing felony theft charges. They were released on $25,000 bail.

3,,Video sparks fears Hong Kong protesters being... | Taiwan News,"
 TAIPEI (Taiwan News) - A video that surfaced on Monday (Nov. 18) appearing to show Hong Kong protesters being loaded onto a train near the border with China has sparked fears online that they are being sent to a detention center in the communist country.
As clashes continued on a university campus between riot police and pro-democracy protesters, a video was posted on Twitter spurring concerns that arrested demonstrators were being illegally extradited to China. At 2:33 p.m. on Monday, Twitter user @Woppa1Woppa posted a video showing handcuffed protesters being forced onto a train and wrote that it was unknown where they were being sent.
Below the Tweet, several netizens identified the train as belonging to the East Rail Line of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. Although the detainees' destination is unknown, netizens pointed out that the last two stations are Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau, which are both border checkpoints into China.
Twitter users suggested that the students were from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which was the scene of fierce clashes between riot police and pro-democracy protesters on Monday. One Twitter user, who goes by the handle @lilisuricate, ominously said that there are no Hong Kong police stations near any of the stops along the train's route to the China border.
The youth activist group Demosisto wrote on Twitter that people in North District ""threw objects on the railway track"" to prevent the protesters from being transported to China. Hong Kong police have yet to issue an official statement on the destination of the arrested demonstrators.

At 12:34 p.m. on Monday, the Facebook group ""Clear Voices from the Island"" (港島你明) uploaded a post which included several photos of apparent protesters allegedly being loaded onto the train. The author of the post then writes that there is a high-resolution photo of a train originating from Hung Hom Station taken at 12:01 p.m. and showing people in handcuffs being led onboard.
The post first gives the time 12:23 p.m. and says ""Mong Kok East Station."" It then states at 12:28 that two vans in the ""upper left [of photo]"" have the license plate numbers VF7046 and AM2837.
The author then requests anyone who recognizes the detainees in the photo to contact the page's administrator.

5,en,'Intolerably offensive': Boy's Nazi costume at elementary school Halloween parade sparks outrage,"
A photo taken of a child wearing a Nazi costume Thursday during a Halloween parade at Creekside Elementary School in Utah. (KTVX/Screengrab via) The student wore a dark brown dress shirt tucked into tan pants with a black tie and matching dress shoes. Had that been the extent of the boy's outfit, he probably wouldn't have drawn much attention as he walked alongside his costumed peers during a Halloween parade at an elementary school in Utah.

But the child's ensemble featured two eye-catching details: a fake toothbrush mustache and a red armband decorated with a hand-drawn black swastika.


Pictures of the student wearing the Nazi costume and sporting Adolf Hitler's distinctive facial hair at Creekside Elementary School, about 20 miles north of Salt Lake City, were shared on social media last week, sparking intense backlash from critics who decried the boy's attire as "" intolerably offensive."" Now, the school's principal and a teacher have been placed on paid administrative leave, and the school district has launched an investigation into ""every aspect of the situation,"" according to a statement emailed to The Washington Post late Sunday.


""The Davis School District apologizes for what took place Thursday at Creekside Elementary,"" the statement said. ""It does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form."" 


Officials with the district, who did not name the principal or the teacher, noted the matter is being taken ""very seriously."" 


A photo showing the boy's costume was first posted to Facebook by a mother of another child who attends the elementary school, according to Deseret News. In a caption, the mother wrote that the boy had also raised the Nazi salute ""in the face of the few minority children who attend the school,"" Deseret News reported. Creekside Elementary School in Kaysville, Utah, serves more than 750 students from preschool to sixth grade.


""This is something that offended a number of people, frightened people, traumatized people to see it,"" Jay Jacobson, who sits on the United Jewish Federation of Utah's board of trustees, told KTVX.


One mother told KSTU that parents at the Halloween parade were confused and surprised the boy had been permitted to dress as a Nazi. The mother added the boy had targeted her son and other children of color on the playground at recess by ""throwing the 'Hail Hitler' sign up."" 


""The fact that it was at a school, he had to have been seen by his teacher, by multiple people,"" said the mother, who was not identified.


She later called the school to complain and was informed the boy had been taken out of the parade and told to change and his parents had been contacted, KSTU reported. But the mother said the school's explanation for the incident didn't sit well with her.


""I was told they thought he was Charlie Chaplin,"" she told the news station, ""and I'm like, he has a whole swastika on his arm."" 


In a statement shared to Facebook on Saturday, the United Jewish Federation of Utah wrote it was ""appalled"" by the boy's attire, stressing that school districts and administrators ""have an obligation to provide guidance to students and parents about what would be an unacceptable costume for such a school parade."" 


""Almost all Jews and Americans regard Hitler and Nazi symbols as signifiers of the worst hatred, racism, and crimes against humanity that the world has known,"" the statement said. ""Dressing a child as Hitler is intolerably offensive and should never be suggested, permitted, or condoned."" 

A father who 'loves history' donned a Nazi uniform for Halloween - and dressed his 5-year-old as Hitler 

Other social media users were equally outraged. One person called out any adults who saw the boy in costume and let him continue to wear it, writing, ""shame on you!"" Another took issue with the school district's decision to suspend the principal and teacher with pay, tweeting, ""It should be 'Fired on the spot and banned from working in schools again.'""

Incidents of anti-Semitism in the United States went up 57 percent between 2016 and 2017, according to a recent report from the Anti-Defamation League. The dramatic rise - the second-highest number reported since the ADL started tracking such data in 1979 - is largely attributed to a ""significant increase"" in cases in schools or on college campuses, the report said.

Nazi salutes and a swastika made of red cups: Newport Beach students condemned for 'abhorrent anti-Semitic activity' 

The Utah boy's costume isn't the first time Nazi imagery has recently shown up at an elementary school in the United States. In May, a Tennessee school announced that it would stop having a student portray Hitler and perform the Nazi salute as part of a fifth-grade class project on World War II, HuffPost reported. The change came after a student complained about the gesture, which some of her peers started doing outside of class, according to BuzzFeed News. More recently, police in Battle Creek, Mich., launched an investigation after a Nazi flag was spotted in September outside Riverside Elementary School, CNN reported.


The Creekside Elementary School mother who spoke to KSTU said she found the boy's clothing and alleged targeting of minority students, including her son, ""completely inappropriate."" 


""Hitler is hurtful,"" the mother said. ""It's hurtful to people. It's a horrible part of the world's past, so it shouldn't be glorified at all.""

 The principal and a teacher at a Kaysville elementary school were suspended with pay after allowing a student to dress in a Nazi costume in a Halloween parade.
 The image of the child - dressed in tan pants and a brown shirt with a red arm band adorned with a black swastika - began circulating on social media after the Thursday parade at Creekside Elementary. Many commenters expressed outrage at whoever allowed the child to wear the costume, while others supported the boy.
 In a statement, the Davis County School District apologized for the costume.
 ""[The district] does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form,"" the statement read. ""The district is taking the matter very seriously and is investigating every aspect of the situation.""
 School district spokesman Chris Williams declined to name the faculty members who were placed on paid leave, but the elementary school's website lists Steve B. Hammer as the principal.
 The school hosts kindergarten through sixth grade students.
 Schools in the district have faced criticism this year for alleged racism and religious insensitivity.

8,en,Bellevue Police arrest 12 men in prostitution sting,"
BELLEVUE, Wash. - Bellevue Police Department detectives arrested 12 men as part of an undercover prostitution sting. This was a two-day sting and the men were arrested at a hotel in the city.
Police said that overall, 66 men responded to a Bellevue vice detective's fake ad on a known prostitution website.
A thirteenth man would have been arrested if that person didn't get lost finding the hotel, Bellevue police said.
Of the 12 that were arrested, one man was from Bellevue, many were from neighboring cities and one man from Georgia responded to the ad.
According to Bellevue Police, prostitution is appealing because the city is affluent, there are many hotels, and it's close proximity to the freeway. Bellevue Police's message is to make it not appealing at all.
""Our goal is to make prostitution not appealing in the city of Bellevue,"" said Bellevue Police Capt. Dave Sanabria. ""We want people who are looking to establish or are trying to make these dates, to stop and think for a moment that the other person at the end of the line, the end of the ad, or the end of that cell phone, that text, could be a detective waiting for them to take them into custody.""
Soliciting a prostitute is a misdemeanor in Bellevue.
Along with pursuing charges, the city prosecutor now recommends that those accused attend a ten-week program called ""Stopping Sexual Exploitation."" The program is a collaboration among the police department, the city's prosecutor's office and an organization called 'Seattle Against Slavery.'
According to Sanabria, the program has been successful elsewhere.
""I think it's an opportunity for these men to really take a hard look at what they're doing and what their role is. Prostitution isn't a victimless crime. A lot of times, these women, they're not in this particular field on their own volition. They're also victims of other crimes. Rape, robbery, aggravated assault,"" said Sanabria.
There have been other instances of prostitution and sex trafficking in Bellevue. In July, police arrested a 36-year-old woman for making an upscale brothel that was in the city's downtown.
Bellevue's Vice Unit has also been proactive in getting victims help. They recently posted on a known prostitution chat forum, specifically reaching out to sex trafficking victims, reminding them that help is out there.

资料显示，1961年3月出生的张琦是安徽寿县人，曾任海南省三亚市委副书记、副市长、省旅游局局长、儋州市市长等职；2010年2月起任儋州市委书记兼洋浦经济开发区工委副书记；2014年9月兼任海南省委常委，升副省级；2014年10月任海南省委常委、三亚市委书记；2016年11月任海南省委常委、海口市委书记至今。
据不完全统计，习近平上台以来，已有254名副部级（包括副军级）以上官员落马。除67名副军级落马官员的贪腐情况未通报外，已有31名贪官的贪腐金额超过了1亿元（官方口径）。
这些贪官，从村官到正国级都有，其中副厅级的山西吕梁前副市长张中生，贪腐10.4亿余元，另有1.3亿余元财产不能说明来源，贪腐金额超过11亿元。张中生创造了截至目前为止所公布的贪官贪腐金额最高纪录。但陆媒《新京报》援引一位接近山西省检察院的消息人士则称，张中生涉案金额超过25亿元。
事实上，中共对于贪官的贪腐额，似乎越是高官，越会故意缩小金额，故此官报数据与外界传闻反差巨大。
 
中共海口市委书记张琦9月6日被""秒杀""，落马当天还登上了当地官媒的头条新闻
比如，官方称中共前政法委书记周永康涉贪1.3亿元，因滥权造成14.86亿余元的损失；但据路透社报导，周永康家族贪腐近1,000亿元。
北京当局并没有通报67名副军级以上落马官员的贪腐情况，包括两名前军委副主席徐才厚、郭伯雄，中共前军委委员张阳、房峰辉等重量级官员。
据港媒称，有中共军官曾踢爆郭伯雄受贿名单，接受高官的""进贡""已有数百亿元，加上买卖官位及土地等收入，估算不少于千亿元，有媒体形容，一个郭伯雄的涉贪金额就可以挽救两个希腊。
另据报导，徐才厚地下室里到处堆放着现金，办案人员一时点不过来，只好拿秤称了一下，再贴上封条。被查抄的美元、欧元、人民币等现金有1吨多重，另有200公斤和田玉，翡翠、上好翡翠原石、古玩器字画，用十几辆军用卡车才运走。
而徐才厚的名言是：我最大的优点就是廉洁！

15,en,UVA reinstates 21-gun salute on Veterans Day after wide-scale backlash,"
 UPDATE (Nov. 18):
The University of Virginia is reinstating the 21-gun salute for next year's Veterans Day ceremonies.
The Daily Progress reports that the university is reversing its decision to drop the salute. University President Jim Ryan announced the change on Saturday. In a Facebook post, Ryan wrote, ""Sometimes you make mistakes.""
The salute has been part of ROTC ceremonies for at least a decade. It normally occurs at the end of cadets' 24-hour vigil on Veterans Day,
University officials had said the decision to nix the salute was made to avoid disrupting classes. Ryan also cited concerns about national gun violence and firing weapons on campus.
Larry Sabato, director of the university's Center for Politics, tweeted that he was glad Ryan reversed course.

ORIGINAL STORY (Nov. 8):
The University of Virginia is coming under fire over a decision to change a part of its annual Veterans Day ceremony.
The university will still hold a Veterans Day ceremony on Monday, but it will no longer include the 21-gun salute. It's a decision UVA leaders say will not change.
The Provost's office, in conjunction with the colonel of UVA's ROTC program, made the decision. The ceremony marks the conclusion of a 24-hour vigil by ROTC cadets and has included the 21-gun salute for more than a decade.
""One is that it would be disruptive to classes and two, unfortunately with gun violence in the U.S., there was some concern that we would cause a panic if someone heard gunshots on grounds,"" said UVA President Jim Ryan.
Veterans like Jay Levine are upset with the decision. Levine went through the ROTC program at UVA and says the 21-gun salute is the ultimate salute to those who have served and passed away.
""I am very disillusioned, very upset, and very surprised that they would make such a decision,"" Levine said.
Levine says he will write an email to UVA about his concerns. He hopes talking in a more public setting will help entice more veterans to take action.
""Freedom isn't free,"" Levine said. ""There's a cost and that cost is born by the veterans and the families of those veterans.""
UVA spokesperson Brian Coy the university hears and respects the concerns raised by members of the community and will continue to engage in the conversation going forward. Coy says UVA fully supports the solemn observance of Veterans Day.
The 24-hour vigil and Veterans Day ceremony will be held in the McIntire Amphitheatre. It begins at 4 p.m. on Monday, November 11 and will conclude on Tuesday, November 12.

16,,"Citing 'gun violence,' UVA cancels 21-gun salute portion of Veterans Day ceremony | The College Fix","
Citing ""gun violence,"" the University of Virginia has canceled the 21-gun salute portion of its Veterans Day ceremony, an annual tradition that dates back at least a decade.
In a statement posted to social media on Saturday, university President James Ryan stated the reason was two-fold: ""to minimize disruptions to classes, given that this event is located at the juncture of four primary academic buildings and is held at a time that classes are in session; and second, recognizing concerns related to firing weapons on the Grounds in light of gun violence that has happened across our nation, especially on school and university campuses.""
According to the local ABC news affiliate WHSV, the annual ceremony ""marks the conclusion of a 24-hour vigil by ROTC cadets and has included the 21-gun salute for more than a decade,"" but the decision to nix the salute was made by the provost's office in conjunction with the colonel of UVA's ROTC program.
Backlash has been so severe Ryan said the university will revisit the issue in 2020.
""[C]ommunity responses have helped us to understand that many see the 21-gun salute as an important element of the Veterans Day ceremony at the University of Virginia. Given that the plans are already in place for this year, we will follow the event organizers' recommendation to proceed without the 21-gun salute in our Veterans Day Ceremony. Following this year's ceremony, however, we will work with our ROTC officers and cadets to take a closer look at options for our Veterans Day events, including those that would enable us to re-introduce the 21-gun salute to the program,"" Ryan stated.
According to media outlets in Virginia, the decision prompted anger. The Daily Progress, the newspaper in Charlottesville, Virginia, published several letters to the editor lambasting the decision.
One letter argued that the decision disrespected the fact that the university's rotunda hosts plaques honoring hundreds of alumni slain in previous wars. Another argued ""veterans deserve better.""
The decision also sent ""an unfortunate message about students: That they are too fragile, too delicate, too distractible to deal with the 'interruption' of the salute. That they are too insular, too wrapped up in their own worlds to comprehend and accept this longstanding practice. That they must be protected from the reality that exists outside academia,"" another letter writer chimed in.
Some Twitter users responding to Ryan's statement were a little more blunt. Among them: ""How 'we' reached the decision? The buck stops with you. Score one for the snowflakes.""
Tweeted another: ""As a @UVA #UVA student veteran, thank you for marginalizing my community. That is a direct, unmitigated slap in the face to those of us who have served, and especially to those of us who have served and lost. I am deeply sorry that you decided to make this incorrect decision.""
However Ryan garnered some support, too, with one replying ""people forget that rampant mass shootings are commonplace now, so it makes sense not to be firing off guns near classrooms,"" and another noting that ""as a long-ago alumna, I want you to know how much you continue to impress. You do our university and your role proud.""

Click here for a free subscription to weekly Todd's newsletter: a must-read for Conservatives!   He said there were two specific reasons.
""First, to minimize disruptions to classes, given that this event is located at the juncture of four primary academic buildings and is held at a time that classes are in session; and second, recognizing concerns related to firing weapons on the Grounds in light of gun violence that has happened across our nation, especially on school and university campuses,"" the president wrote. 
As you might imagine - the outrage among veterans and military supporters has been severe.
""It also, ironically, sends an unfortunate message about students: That they are too fragile, too delicate, too distractible to deal with the 'interruption' of the salute. That they are too insular, too wrapped up in their own worlds to comprehend and accept this longstanding practice. That they must be protected from the reality that exists outside academia,"" they wrote. 
The blowback was apparently so significant - that President Ryan promised to re-introduce the 21-gun salute next year.
The notion that students might suffer some sort of disruption because the ROTC is honoring our veterans is repulsive. 
""The use of gun salutes for military occasions is traced to early warriors who demonstrated their peaceful intentions by placing their weapons in a position that rendered them ineffective,"" the center explained. ""The 21-gun salute became the highest honor a nation rendered.""
The University of Virginia may think they are protecting their overly sensitive students, but in reality they are disrespecting our veterans.
